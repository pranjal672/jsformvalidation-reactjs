# Auth Application

This project was my first attempt of learning JavaScript using the tutorial series of Dave Gray from YouTube. I followed the techniques and created a login and registration form using React. It also has a backend server built on Express.js and deployed on Render. The frontend is deployed on Vercel. Authorization and Authentication using JWT. Roles based authorization.
